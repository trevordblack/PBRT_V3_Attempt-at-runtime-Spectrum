# PBRT_V3_Attempt-at-runtime-Spectrum
My Aborted attempt at configuring a runtime spectrum solver for PBRT-V3. I wager I got 70% of the way there. The remaining 30% are significant enough architectural changes that I would be barking up the wrong tree. Further research has led me to believe that this isn't a thing that people use, or would use.
